## A simple script to ensure proper chroot-ing

I thought I might try my hand in bash scripting since I had made a script like this before.
So Keyboard hit the `nano` and off I went.

This script ensures the proper chroot environment for any one with chroot.
This script currently has extra support for Debian and SUSE based systems, but should work with any `bash`.

The easychroot_changelog.txt should have everything you need for changes I have made, and version history. Eventually I will split this up into a stable and beta branch but for now who cares as long as it works.

Enjoy!
