## A simple script to ensure proper chroot-ing

I thought I might try my hand in bash scripting since I had made a script like this before.
So Keyboard hit the `nano` and off I went.

This script ensures the proper chroot environment for any one with chroot.
This script currently has extra support for Debian, Ubuntu, and WSL, but should work with anyone.

Enjoy!
