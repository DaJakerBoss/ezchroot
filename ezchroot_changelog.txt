EasyChroot! 
The brainchild of Jake
With so many different issues with chroot, why not just make a stinkin' script?
So keyboard hit the 'nano' and off I went!
This is my re-introduction to bash scripting.
I had a previous script that actually utilized tools like 'parted' and made visual menus, but has since been wiped from existence.
So I made a new one. This one will be taken a step at a time.

Version key:
The last number is for minor code changes
The second number is for added support
The first number is for major changes (e.g. dialouge menus, which will come in v 1.0.0)
v 0.0.0 is trash

>#Changelog!#<
>EasyChroot v 0.0.0
Hot glue guns and duct tape! 
The initial patching together of commands and if/then's. 
Only WSL support for now.

>EasyChroot v 0.0.1
Woohoo! It actually runs!
Made the mental move from TI-BASIC to BASH scripting for if/then.
'Check if root' actually works now.
Fixed 'if' arguments.
Noted: TI-Basic is a hell-of-a-lot different than BASH.

>EasyChroot v 0.0.2
Did some tyding for looks inside and outside
Added native linux support
Fixed an issue where had you not have mounted your partitions in Windows, it teleported you to linux.
Fixed an issue where a missing quotation mark screwed eveything up
Updated some dialouges

>EasyChroot v 0.0.3
Added native Ubuntu and Debian support using parted
Fixed an issue mounting a drive with the -t option and no parameter

>EasyChroot v 0.0.4
Changed method of OS idenification from DISTRIB_ID to ID_LIKE.
Added apt installer for Debian. Now Universal.
Remembered to change version number in the script.
Those quotation marks are going to kill me.

>EasyChroot v 0.0.5
Added SUSE support
silent zypper
added conditionals for install `parted`
' and " are interchangeble, I guess. I hate bash.

>EasyCHroot 0.0.6 
Gave chroot internet access
